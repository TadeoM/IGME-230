                <p>    My name is Tadeo Menichelli, I am a second year Game Design and Development student at RIT.
                    I am very interested in programming and designing video games, clearly because of my major.
                    I started coding my senior year of High school, and in that time, I'd say I've gotten pretty
                    far, the field that I am most interested in programming is Gameplay and AI. these two areas deeply
                    deeply interest me because they are the areas that the player most closely interacts with.
                    Good AI make the player feel like they are playing with another intelligent being. While good
                    gameplay makes the player feel great when tdey're playing the game.
