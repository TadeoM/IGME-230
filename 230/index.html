          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>Heyo. I am Tadeo Menichelli, a 2nd year Game Design and Development Student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I love anything that has to do with games. I'm always looking for new board games and video games. I enjoy to ride on horseback, longboard, and snowboard. I hope to be able to make a nice looking portfolio page so that possible employers don't need to look at an ugly page when seeing what I've accomplished. Out of this major I hope to make many connections in the Game   Industry and get a job in one of many companies. At RIT I hope to make lifelong friends that will last for my life. When I graduate the ideal place to be is at a company that I love, working in a position that I want, hopefully that will happen, however I know that it does not always work out like this, so I am more than happy to just get a decent job in the Game Industry and work hard to get to where I want to be!</p>
