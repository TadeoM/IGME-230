# Placeholder Game Name

## I. Concept
It's Pong but with more obstacles and 
-ups
* probably more like pong meets Ballz

## II. Genre
* Sports Game
* Defense?
* Casual
* Simplistic

## III. Platform
Will be available for desktop, possibly universal

## IV. Story
You are a professional tennis player who wants to beat every player EVER. It's just pong.

## V. Esthetics
* photo-realistic....jk its abstract
* 8-bit
* sounds for scoring, hitting the pong ball, picking up power-ups maybe even background music.

## VI. Gameplay
### Mechanics
* you hit the ball with your paddle to knock it in the opposite direction
* there are obstacles with a random number, you have to hit it to destroy it
..* once it's destroyed the player who destroyed gets the points (maybe, not sure how ridiculous/rage-inducing this would be
* power-ups can be hit with the ball, and that player gets the power-up
* new balls spawn everyone once in a while (need to test on specifics for how often)

### Control
* keyboard

### Teaching the game/New user experience
* powe-ups, blocks and new balls will all be slowly be implemented into a game, so the player can kind of just figure it out because it'll happen naturally

### Player Learning
* there isn't much to learn, just learn what the power-ups are and how to score
